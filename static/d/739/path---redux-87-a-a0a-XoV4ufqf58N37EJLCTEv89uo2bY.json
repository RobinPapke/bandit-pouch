The preferred way to do this is to use the\nfollowing functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>createActionNoArgs</li>\n<li>createActionWithPayload</li>\n<li>createActionWithMeta</li>\n<li>createActionWithPayloadAndMeta</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These functions restrict the signatures of the Actions to have zero to many meta arguments and zero or one payload\narguments. Meta arguments are used to identify the data that is being manipulated in the redux store, and the\npayload argument is incoming data that is to be reduced.</p>\n<p>Example Usage</p>\n<pre><code>import {\n     createActionNoArgs,\n     createActionWithMeta,\n     createActionWithPayload,\n     createActionWithPayloadAndMeta,\n } from \"common-ui\";\n\n\n export default {\n     // No meta or payload\n     requestList: createActionNoArgs(\"category.list@request\"),\n\n     // No meta, payload contains an array of categories received from the endpoint\n     receiveList: createActionWithPayload(\"category.list@receive\"),\n\n     // Meta identifies the category to store by alias\n     requestStore: createActionWithMeta(\"category.store@request\", ['alias']),\n\n     // Meta identifies the category to store by alias, payload contains the just-stored category details\n     receiveStore: createActionWithPayloadAndMeta(\"category.store@receive\", ['alias']),\n }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Actions are functions which create objects which are dispatched via redux and reduced into the store by reducers.</p>\n<p>Example Usage</p>\n<pre><code>// (Actions) Create an action\naction = createActionWithPayloadAndMeta(\"database.tables.columns@receive\", ['alias', 'schema', 'table']);\n\n// (Component) Dispatch an action\ndispatch(action({ (payload) }, 'myAlias', 'mySchema', 'myTable');\n\n// (Reducers) Handle the dispatched action via a Reducer to reduce the new payload into the store\n[action]: (state, {error, payload, meta: {alias, schema, table}}) =>\n</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"id":"redux-actions","title":"Actions"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}}
